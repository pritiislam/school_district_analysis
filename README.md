## Overview of the School District Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to assist the school board by providing a high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics, such as the top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, overall student passing rate, and average math/reading scores for each grade level at each school. Additionally, we will also analyze key metrics for each school, such as school performance based on budget, school performance based on school size, and school performance based on type of school.
